# schnitzler-bahr-data
XML-files with correspondence pieces, diary entries, texts and notes from the scholarly edition of Hermann Bahr – Arthur Schnitzler: Briefwechsel, Aufzeichnungen, Dokumente (1891–1931)

The website is hosted here: https://bahrschnitzler.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/ (might move in the foreseeable future)

The book derived from the data can be downloaded here: https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/30272

While the data still is benificiary for people working in the field, four years after it’s creation there are other public offerings with similar data:

* The extracts taken from the diary of Arthur Schnitzler are better curated than those of https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/schnitzler-tagebuch-data. They reference persons mentioned indirectly, include organisations and the proper words are in rs-tags. (In the diary repo the indices consist mostly of entities mentionned on a specific date.)
* Several of the letters included here were quoted from books. Many of those have been revised and expanded by accessing the archival sources for https://schnitzler-briefe.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/, i.e. https://github.com/arthur-schnitzler/schnitzler-briefe-data 
* The main derivation between the correspondence pieces of the core correspondence between Bahr and Schnitzler is that the data for https://schnitzler-briefe.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/ was revised to include the lange s (»ſ«) instead of having it represented by the character »s«

Nevertheless there are letters to Schnitzler and Bahr, texts and diary entries, that are not included on https://schnitzler-briefe.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/ so it’s still worth a look.
